# breast_cancer_detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning techniques. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify tumors as malignant or benign, enabling early diagnosis and reducing the risk of mortality.


## In this project, we:

- Explore and preprocess the Breast Cancer dataset.

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features.

- Apply machine learning models for classification.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Visualize results for better interpretability.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

  
## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-detection.git
cd breast-cancer-detection

2. Install dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells:
jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Detection_Final_submission.ipynb


# 📊 Results

* Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.

* Provided feature importance insights to identify key biomarkers.
